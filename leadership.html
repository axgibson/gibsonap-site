    <h2>My Leadership Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My leadership philosophy is grounded in relationships, systems, accountability, and growth. I believe in building a school culture where students and teachers are supported, challenged, and inspired to reach their highest potential. Effective leadership starts with listening, continues with strategy, and flourishes through collaboration.
    </p>

    <h3>🔗 Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      At the heart of every successful school are strong relationships. I invest time in getting to know staff, students, and families because trust is the foundation of progress. By being visible, approachable, and consistent, I’ve built meaningful connections that enhance communication and cooperation.
    </p>

    <h3>🛠 Systems & Structure</h3>
    <p>
      I believe in building clear, replicable systems that support learning and behavior. Whether it’s universal classroom expectations or consistent communication through Canvas, systems should empower educators and students to focus on what matters most: teaching and learning.
    </p>

    <h3>🤝 Accountability & Support</h3>
    <p>
      Holding high standards goes hand in hand with providing support. I work with teachers as a partner — offering coaching, data insight, and honest conversations. For students, I believe in both firm expectations and restorative support.
    </p>

    <h3>📈 Growth-Minded Culture</h3>
    <p>
      I lead with a growth mindset — for myself and those I serve. Continuous improvement, professional learning, and a willingness to adapt are essential. I model reflection and feedback in all I do.
    </p>

    <h3>🧭 Alignment with AVID</h3>
    <p>
      My leadership aligns closely with AVID’s core principles. WICOR strategies, student agency, and college/career readiness aren’t just buzzwords — they’re foundational practices I embed in every initiative, from instructional planning to student discipline.
