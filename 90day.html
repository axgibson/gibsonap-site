    <h2>üìÖ My 90-Day Action Plan</h2>
    <p>This plan explicityly outlines my immediate leadership priorities to support Camp Creek Middle School through intentional, AVID-aligned systems that improve instruction, culture, and student achievement.</p>

      <h3>üéØ Goal 1: Build Relational Capacity<img src="smaller.png" alt="AVID badge" class="avid-icon">
</h3>
      <p><strong>SMART Goal:</strong> By September 22, 2025, I will lead the adoption of Universal Classroom Systems in at least 90% of classrooms to enhance structure, and student engagement, ultimately strengthening climate, culture, and relational capacity.

  		<li>Greeting students at the door</li>
  		<li>Intimate knowledge of student interests</li>
  		<li>Positive interactions outside the classroom</li>

  </div>
<div class="callout-box">
  <h4>üìé Problem-Solving Framework in Action</h4>
  <p>
    I will continue to use a <strong>PBIS-aligned Discipline Problem-Solving Framework</strong> to diagnose and address behavioral challenges with precision and consistency.
    This tool helps leadership teams pinpoint root causes, define SMART goals, and implement targeted, restorative interventions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôve worked with this framework to lead inquiry-based conversations that resulted in a <strong>26% reduction in Office Discipline Referrals</strong>,
    <strong>a 40% reduction in OSS days</strong>, and <strong>a 99% reduction in ISS days</strong> for the 24‚Äì25 school year.
    It will remain a key part of my approach to behavior data and climate improvement.
