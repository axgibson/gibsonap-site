    <h2>
  AVID Isnâ€™t an Add-On â€” It <em>Is</em> the System
  <img src="small.png" alt="AVID icon" class="avid-icon">
</h2>
    <p>
      AVID isn't something we do on the side â€” it's the system that will power everything we do at Camp Creek Middle School. From instruction to intervention, AVID strategies shape our schoolwide approach to teaching, learning, and leadership.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ”Ž Why AVID Matters</h3>
    <p>
      AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) builds college and career readiness by teaching students how to think critically, collaborate, and take ownership of their learning. I lead with AVID because it provides a universal instructional language, grounded in equity and excellence.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ“ˆ Using Data to Drive WICOR</h3>
    <p>
      Based on recent CCRPI data, only <strong>57.4%</strong> of students at Camp Creek are reading at or above grade level, and ELA proficiency stands at <strong>52.44%</strong>. AVIDâ€™s writing strategies â€” on-demand responses, focused note-taking, and inquiry-based reflection â€” are central to our schoolwide plan to raise ELA achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While our Progress score is a strength (<strong>87.2</strong>), AVID provides the structure to narrow subgroup gaps. Through student goal setting and transparent feedback, WICOR strategies empower every learner to track and drive their own growth.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ§  Culture, Climate & Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      AVID doesn't stop at academics â€” it shapes how we build culture. PBIS data reveals a need to deepen relationships and student agency. By aligning discipline practices with AVIDâ€™s relational capacity, we foster a climate where expectations are clear and restorative strategies are prioritized.
    </p>
<h3>ðŸ”¬ A Cross-Curricular Commitment</h3>
<p>
  Our CCRPI and Student Achievement data reveals opportunities for growth in <strong>all core content areas</strong>. Thatâ€™s why our cross-curricular AVID-aligned strategies will increase content mastery in all subject areas.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Math:</strong> We promote collaborative problem-solving, graphic organizers, and structured note-taking (e.g., Cornell Notes) to support retention and rigor.</li>
  <li><strong>Science:</strong> Students engage in inquiry-based labs, use WICOR to organize data, and write lab reflections to deepen conceptual understanding.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Studies:</strong> Emphasis on text annotation, document-based questioning, and historical analysis supports critical thinking and reading in context.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  AVID gives our teachers the tools to scaffold instruction and increase engagement in every subject â€” not just language arts.
</p>

    <h3>ðŸ›  AVID Strategies in Action</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Writing to Learn:</strong> On-demand writing, focused notes, reflections</li>
      <li><strong>Inquiry:</strong> Structured questioning, Socratic seminars, Costaâ€™s levels</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Study groups, peer feedback, group roles</li>
      <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Grade checks, binders, goal-setting logs</li>
      <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Marking the text, critical reading strategies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These strategies arenâ€™t isolatedâ€”theyâ€™re built into enrichment, core instruction, Canvas usage, PLC planning, and schoolwide systems.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ“Œ AVID at the Center of the 90-Day Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Every goal in my 90-Day Action Plan is aligned to AVID â€” from implementing Universal Classroom Systems to training teachers in Canvas through WICOR-aligned templates. AVID isnâ€™t an add-on â€” it is the system.
